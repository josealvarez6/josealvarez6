ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Jose Alvarez!

I'm a Software Developer in Progress with a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning. After running my own Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy for years, I sold the business to focus on completing my Computer Science Degree at SNHU and diving deep into software development.

Currently, I work as an IT Analyst for a Health System in Georgia, where I apply my technical skills while sharpening my knowledge in Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to transition into a full-time Software Engineer and contribute to impactful projects that push my abilities.

I document my journey at WhiteBeltDev.com, where I showcase my projects and track my growth from beginner to expertâ€”just like my journey in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. When I started BJJ, I had no idea of the challenges and breakthroughs ahead. Now, I speak a different language with a deep understanding I couldn't conceptualize as a white belt. I believe software development is the same: if I keep showing up, putting in the work, studying, facing challenges, and seeking guidance, one day, Iâ€™ll earn my black belt in software engineering.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and build something awesome!
